# Hi, I’m Dee 👋

I build revenue engines that scale early-stage startups, turning $2M ARR companies into $50M+ growth machines through data-driven marketing.
12+ years scaling SaaS and B2B businesses across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC, from seed-stage to global platforms.


## 🚀 What I Do
- **Demand Generation & Growth Marketing** — inbound, outbound, PLG, ABM. 200%+ pipeline growth and retention programs that stick. 
- **Product-Led Growth (PLG)** — self-serve acquisition, trial optimization, and activation experiments. 43% conversion improvement through systematic testing.  
- **Lifecycle & Retention Marketing** — onboarding, renewal campaigns, behavioral triggers. 28% churn reduction through automation and personalization.  
- **Partnership & Ecosystem Development** — built 200+ global partnerships (Americas, EMEA, APAC) generating 25%+ of qualified pipeline through co-marketing and referrals.  
- **Data-Driven Optimization** — CAC/LTV, funnel velocity, predictive lead scoring, and campaign ROI.  
- **Program & Campaign Ops** — timelines, vendors, launches, swag, events… if it needs shipping, I make it happen.  
- **DevRel & Community Support** — onboarding, API education campaigns, and developer-first adoption strategies.  

## 🤝 How I Work
**On decision-making:** I lead with data. Every major decision starts with clarity on what we're measuring and why. I bias toward testing, learn fast, and let the data guide the next move.

**On collaboration:** I work cross-functionally with curiosity, not ego. Marketing doesn't win in a silo. The best outcomes come from partnering with Product, Engineering, Sales, and Design to solve problems together.

**On leadership:** I build high-autonomy teams with clear goals and direct feedback. Once direction is set, I trust people to execute, then I focus on removing blockers and accelerating outcomes. I've scaled teams through thoughtful hiring, systematic onboarding, and creating environments where testing and learning quickly is the default.

**On communication:** I practice compassionate candor. Direct feedback delivered with respect and context. No sugar-coating, no surprises. Clear expectations upfront, honest conversations throughout, and recognition when people ship great work.


## 🌍 A Bit More
- Global experience across **Americas, EMEA, APAC**.  
- Passionate about helping **open source + devtool companies** scale adoption without losing their edge.  
- Firm believer that great marketing is like great code: well-documented, collaborative, and built to iterate.  

## ✨ A Little Bit More
- 🌱 Known to care for plants with the same consistency I bring to campaigns.  
- 🚀 Known to organize launch timelines the way I organize my 99 customized playlists.  
- 🕶️ I believe in dark mode, shipping fast but eating slow.  
- 💰 Yes, I’ve run hackathons, and yes, I’ve also bribed devs with good swag and free lunch.

✨ **Every great launch starts with clarity — then the growth follows.** ✨
