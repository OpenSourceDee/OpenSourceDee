# Hi, I’m Dee 👋

I build structure in the chaos so that **developers, products, and communities can grow.**  
12+ years scaling SaaS and B2B businesses across the **Americas, EMEA, and APAC** — from $2M ARR to 50M ARR startups to global platforms.  

## 🚀 What I Do
- **Demand Generation & Growth Marketing** — inbound, outbound, PLG, ABM. 200%+ pipeline growth and retention programs that stick.  
- **Program & Campaign Ops** — timelines, vendors, launches, swag, events… if it needs shipping, I make it happen.  
- **DevRel & Community Support** — hackathons, onboarding, API education campaigns, and developer-first adoption strategies.  
- **Data-Driven Optimization** — CAC/LTV, funnel velocity, predictive lead scoring, and campaign ROI.  

## 🤝 How I Work
I practice **README-driven marketing**: clarity first, then execution.  
That means turning ambitious ideas into structured projects, documenting processes, and ensuring every campaign, event, or launch ships on time and with impact.  

## 🌍 A Bit More
- Global experience across **Americas, EMEA, APAC**.  
- Passionate about helping **open source + devtool companies** scale adoption without losing their edge.  
- Firm believer that great marketing is like great code: well-documented, collaborative, and built to iterate.  

## ✨ A Little Bit More
- 🌱 Known to care for plants with the same consistency I bring to campaigns.  
- Known to organize launch timelines the way some people organize playlists.  
- Believe in dark mode, and shipping fast but eating slow.  
- Yes, I’ve run hackathons — and yes, I’ve also bribed devs with good swag.

📈 *Every great launch starts with clarity — then the growth follows.*
